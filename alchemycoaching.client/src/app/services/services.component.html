        <div class="service-description">Our individual services are designed to meet you where you are. The Alchemy approach is non-pathologizing, meaning the focus is not on illness or disorder ("normal" is a setting on laundry machines!); instead our work will focus on building mindful coping strategies within a strengths-based, solutions-focused framework. Frequent topics include: career exploration and planning, setting and holding boundaries, self-esteem, mindful living, burnout care and prevention, and creating more fulfilling relationships. This work will increase self-knowing and compassion, enhance effective emotional management, and allow for a greater capacity for happiness in your life.</div>
